Dear Dr. Richard M. Aron,
\vspace{.5cm}

We wish to submit a new manuscript entitled ``Periodic solutions of
Euler-Lagrange equations with sublinear pontentials   in an Orlicz-Sobolev space setting'' for consideration by  Journal of Mathematical Analysis and Applications.

We confirm that this work is original and has not been published elsewhere nor is it currently under consideration for publication elsewhere.

In this paper, we report on equations of Euler-Lagrange type in a Orlicz-Sobolev space setting. This is significant because this issue has not been discussed in depth in the literature and becasuse it is of interest in mechanic models.  The paper should be of interest to readers in the areas of nonlinear ode, hamiltonian system, variational calculus and applications of Orlicz spaces.

Please address all correspondence concerning this manuscript to me at 

\texttt{fmazzone@exa.unrc.edu.ar}

Thank you for your consideration of this manuscript. 

Sincerely,
\vspace{.5cm}
